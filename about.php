            Hey there visitor! I'm Shahlin Ibrahim, if you didn't know that already. I'm currently doing my Bachelors in Computer Science (3<sup>rd</sup> year) in <b>University of Wollongong in Dubai</b>. I'm from Mangalore, India. I've been in the U.A.E for about 15 years now. Haven't learned to speak the language though. But I've learned many other <i>languages</i>. ;)<br><br>

            <strong>Why Computer Science?</strong><br>
            Computers have been my thing for a long time now. It started back when we used dial up connections to access the internet. Created my first e-mail account then. <i>Yahoo!</i> As I got comfortable with the whole system, I started diving deep into it. I used to try out different operating systems (mostly Linux based), disassemble laptops, make computer related tutorials on Youtube, etc. When I was in 9th grade, me and my friend started learning web development. I did back-end and he did front-end. Took us about a year to get used to all the concepts and programming since it was self-taught. But it was worth it. Helped me a lot later when I actually started learning programming. Was always ahead of the other students. Well, that might be a bit of an exaggeration but hey, I'm a positive person and there's no problem in praising yourself now and then. I've been continuing this initial interest of developing websites since about 6 years I think. Still learning. Always learning.
